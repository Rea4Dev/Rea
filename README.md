The Rea repository is my personal repository, where I currently (almost daily) perform my main activities as a Bachelor's student in Software Engineering. 
The folders within this repository relate to different things, which is quite explicit. 
Perhaps in the future, I will create different repositories for different topics, but currently, that is not my focus and need.
